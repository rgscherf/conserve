# Super Conservation Officer (SCO)

It needs a better name.

## Overview

SCO is a puzzle-y roguelike. You play as a conservation officer, trying to balance an ecosystem of AI animals. Each type of animal has different behaviors and a different place in the food web.

The design goal is that these variables will be interesting in their own right, as well as forming surprising tactical puzzles when they're combined in random ways.

SCO is my first game, so development will be really slow probably!
